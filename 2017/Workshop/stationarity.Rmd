We started the discussion by using autoorrelation as a measure of independence. Let's revisit that.

For univariate data, we typically assume the model
$$
y_i = \mu + e_i
$$
where $\mu$ is some constant and $e_i$ is a white noise process.



# Example (Simulated) Data

We'll keep using the same simulated data as before.


```{r}
set.seed(1000)
alpha <- 0.8
beta <- 0.8
white.noise <- rnorm(200)
random.walk <- rep(0,200)
autoregressive <- rep(0,200)
moving.average <- rep(0,200)
moving.average[1] <- white.noise[1]
for(i in 2:200) {
  random.walk[i] <- random.walk[i-1]+white.noise[i]
  autoregressive[i] <- alpha*autoregressive[i-1]+white.noise[i-1]
  moving.average[i] <- beta*white.noise[i-1]+white.noise[i]
}
x <- 1:200
coefs.walk <- coef(lm(random.walk ~ x + I(x^2) + I(x^3) + I(x^4) + I(x^5)))
coefs.walk
trend.error <- coefs.walk[1] + coefs.walk[2]*x + coefs.walk[3]*I(x^2)+ coefs.walk[4]*I(x^3) + coefs.walk[5]*I(x^4) + coefs.walk[6]*I(x^5) + white.noise
```
